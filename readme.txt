GUI Mockup Notes

Page 1:

- Upon initial entry to the site, users should be presented a clear choice between two possible actions: creating an account, or using an already created account to access the site.  This service is only intended to be used by FAU Students and Faculty, so there's not meant to be anything publically accessible by anyone wihtout an account.

-The Create Account button would link to a standard form for filling out account information, requiring the user to make a username/password and to provide authentication that they are related to the school in some capacity.

-The Login button would bring up a quick username/password entry field, which would then link to the main feed page of the site provided a matching login combination was found.
